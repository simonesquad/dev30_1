// Step 1: creating a variable of my individal age as a number type
var myAge = 20

// Step 2: creating a variable for early years that is subject to change
var earlyYears = 2

// Step 3:
earlyYears *= 10.5

// Step 4: altering the myAge variable 
var laterYears = myAge - 2

// Step 5:
var dogYears = laterYears * 4

// Step 6: Sanity Check
console.log(earlyYears)
console.log(laterYears)

// Step 7: the combination step
var myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears

// Step 8: simply naming myself
string = 'Simone'
var myName = string.toLowerCase()

// Step 9: use of temperate literals
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`)
